Q038
Count and Say
Easy

:string:

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the
first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30, generate the nth term of the
count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from
the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits
in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Notes:
    This problem is not explained very clearly. This is called look and say
    sequence.
